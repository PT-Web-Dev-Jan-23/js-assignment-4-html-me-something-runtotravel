         <p>In 2022, my partner, Jean, and I went on a significant amount of trips both nationally and internationally.  We absolutely loved getting to travel so much after being confined to St. Louis during the previous two years due to COVID. Below is a bit about each trip.</p>

         <h2> Kansas City, Kansas</h2>
         <h3><em>February</em></h3>
         <p>
            Jean had to get his passport renewed, and the closest place to do that was Kansas City. He had to make an appointment in advance and we planned our trip around the appointment date. The night before we left, a huge snow storm came through St. Louis and the whole city shut down. His car was stuck, so we shoveled it out, and then proceeded to get stuck several times going down his street, so I kept getting out to push the car. He drove slowly the entire way, and we finally made it! Once we were safely there, we enjoyed our time exploring downtown, going to the KC Art Museum, and going to a jazz club. It was quite an adventure!

         <h2> Mexico City, Mexico</h2>
         <h3><em>March</em></h3>
         <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">
            We went to Mexico City for spring break, and it was a wonderful change from being in cold St. Louis. Jean is from Mexico City, so we stayed with his family. They took us to beautiful towns around Mexico City, we went to a market and bought pulque, Jean showed me his former university, and we spent a lot of time exploring Mexico City.

         <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
         <h3><em>June</em></h3>
         <p>
            We went to Costa Rica for about 10 days. We flew into San Jos&eacute; spent a couple days there, and then went to the west coast around Parque National Manuel Antonio. In San Jos&eacute;, we enjoyed going to the downtown market and trying delicious places to eat. We also found an awesome brewery that we went to a couple times. In Parque National Manuel Antonio, we spent time at the beach and saw sloths, monkeys, and other amazing animals in the National Park. We also went on an excursion to a mountain we climbed up then slept in a cave at the top of it. There was a waterfall in front of the cave and we rappelled down it the next day!

         <h2>Grand Tetons and Rocky Mountain National Parks</h2>
         <h3><em>July</em></h3>
         <p>
            My parents and brother and his family try to go to several National Parks each summer. This year, two of the National Parks they went to were Grand Tetons and Rocky Mountain. I met up with them and enjoyed several days with them. We hiked, saw waterfalls, explored Jackson Hole, and just enjoyed spending time together.

         <h2>Columbia, Missouri</h2>
         <h3><em>August</em></h3>
         <p>
            Jean and I went to Columbia to see a band called The Breeders. This was a quick trip and we didn't even spend the night, but it was fun! We drove to Columbia after work, enjoyed the show, and then drove back to St. Louis. A quick, fun getaway.

         <h2>Chicago, Illinois</h2>
         <h3><em>September</em></h3>
         <p>
            We went to Chicago to see a band called The Mars Volta. This is a band we have both loved for years - since the early 2000s. They had a huge impact on the music I got into during that time of my life, but I had never seen them live. It was an amazing show and I couldn't belive I was finally seeing them live after 20 years! We enjoyed our time in Chicago as well. We ate great food and enjoyed walking around the city.

         <h2>New Orleans, Louisiana</h2>
         <h3><em>November</em></h3>
         <p>
            Some of Jean's friends got married in New Orleans, so we got to go! Neither one of us had been to New Orleans before. We had a great time walking around the city, going to a po' boy festival, eating delicious food, riding the trolly, and listing to awesome live music. We had a blast exploring a city that was new to both of us.

         <h2>Austin, Texas</h2>
         <h3><em>December</em></h3>
         <p>
               My parents live in Forth Worth, Texas, so we visited them for a few days during Christmas and then made our way to Austin for several days and stayed there for New Year's. We stayed in a camper in someone's backyard and it was such a fun experience! We took our dog with us and enjoyed walking with her downtown.  We found some dog-friendly patios and breweries that we were able to take her to. We also found a really cool speakeasy mezcal bar on a roof that was fun and unique.
